The air pollution levels in the UK in 2021 were estimated using three spatial interpolation techniques: K-nearest neighbors, inverse distance weighting, and Voronoi models.


The data was collected from 85 sites across the UK and the mean pollution level was obtained for each site. A grid of points was fitted over the map of the UK and the methods were employed to predict the pollution levels across the area.

The results were then compared and the best performing method was selected to create an ensemble model. In addition, the INLA model was used to obtain the statistical significance of the modeled predictions by providing upper and lower bounds.
